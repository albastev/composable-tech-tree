# Examples

This directory contains reference example packs for the **Composable Tech Tree Engine**.

## Current Example Pack

- `magic-tech-crossover/`
  - `example-magic-tech-crossover.json`
  - `README.md`

Start with `magic-tech-crossover/README.md` for a human-readable walkthrough of the example and how to use it.

## Planned Example Packs

As described in `docs/overview.md`, this directory is intended to expand with additional scenario-focused examples, such as:

- `simple-stone-to-iron/`
- `fusion-multiple-paths/`
- `magic-tech-crossover/`
- `chemistry-stoichiometry/`
- `sophistication-scaling/`
- `discovery-tinkerer/`

## Purpose

Example packs are meant to help:

- **Engine integrators** understand expected data shapes and modeling patterns.
- **Content creators** bootstrap their own technology trees and requirement definitions.
- **Application developers** test query/discovery flows with realistic capability combinations.
